                <h3>Who we are</h3>
                <p>Michael Miller, founder of MMS, has served in Long Term Care and Assisted Living communities for
                    over
                    a decade. As CEO of a well-known senior living community, he faced the need of a good medical
                    staffing partner. Noticing deficiencies in the quality of service that agencies provided, along
                    with
                    low compensation to their staff, he was inspired to make a change in the perception that agency
                    staff is just another "warm body" in the building. Miller Medical Staffing is raising the bar.
                    We
                    provide nothing less than exemplary services to our communities, and our team receives great pay
                    and
                    exciting new opportunities!</p>
